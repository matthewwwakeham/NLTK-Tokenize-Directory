Eighty-One

Truthful words are not beautiful.
Beautiful words are not truthful.
Good people do not argue.
Those who argue are not good.
Those who know are not learned.
The learned do not know.

The wise never try to hold onto things.
The more you do for others, the more you have.
The more you give to others, the greater your abundance.
The Tao of heaven is sharp but does no harm.
The Tao of the wise is to work without effort.

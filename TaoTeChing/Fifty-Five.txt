Fifty-Five

If you are filled with Virtue you are like a newborn child.
Wasps and serpents will not harm you;
Wild beasts will not pounce on you;
You will not be attacked by birds of prey.
Your bones are soft, your muscles weak,
But your grip is firm.
You have not experienced the union of man and woman, yet you are whole.
You are strong.
You may shout all day without becoming hoarse.
This is perfect harmony.

Knowing harmony is constancy.
Knowing constancy is enlightenment.

It is not wise to rush about.
Trying to control the breath causes strain.
If too much energy is used, exhaustion follows.
This is not the way of Tao.
Whatever is contrary to Tao will not last long.

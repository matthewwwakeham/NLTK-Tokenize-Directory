Fifty-Six

Those who know do not talk.
Those who talk do not know.

Close your mouth.
Guard your senses.
Temper your sharpness.
Simplify your problems.
Mask your brightness.
Be at one with the dust of the earth.
This is primal union.

Those who have achieved this state
Do not distinguish between friends and enemies,
Between good and harm, between honor and disgrace.
This is the highest state of a being.

Fifty

Between birth and death,
Three in ten are followers of life,
Three in ten are followers of death,
And people just passing from birth to death also number three in ten.
Why is this so?
Because they live their lives on the gross level.

Those who know how to live walk abroad
Without fear of rhinoceroses or tigers.
They will not be wounded in battle.
For in them the rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn,
Nor the tiger to use its claws,
And weapons no place to pierce.
Why is this so?
Because they have no place for death to enter.

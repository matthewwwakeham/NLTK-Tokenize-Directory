Five

Heaven and earth are impartial;
They see the ten thousand things as they are.
The wise are impartial;
They see the people as they are.

The space between heaven and earth is like a bellows.
The shape changes but not the form;
The more it moves, the more it yields.
More words count less.
Hold fast to the center.

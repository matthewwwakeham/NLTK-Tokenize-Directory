Forty-Eight

In the pursuit of learning, something is acquired every day.
In the pursuit of the Tao, every day something is relinquished.

Less and less is done
Until non-action is achieved.
When nothing is done, nothing is left undone.

The world is governed by letting things take their course.
It cannot be governed through interference.

Forty-Nine

The wise do not hold opinions.
They are aware of the needs of others.

I am good to people who are good.
I am also good to people who are not good
Because Virtue is goodness.
I have faith in people who are faithful.
I also have faith in people who are not faithful
Because Virtue is faithfulness.

The wise are shy and humble
They behave like small children.
To the world they seem confusing.
Yet people look to them and listen.

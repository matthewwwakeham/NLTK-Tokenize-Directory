Forty-Six

When the Tao is present in the universe,
The horses haul manure.
When the Tao is absent from the universe,
War horses are bred outside the city.

There is no greater sin than craving,
No greater curse than discontent,
No greater misfortune than wanting something for ourselves.
Therefore those who know that enough is enough will always have enough.

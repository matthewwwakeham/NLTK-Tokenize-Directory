Forty-Two

The Tao begot one.
One begot two.
Two begot three.
And three begot the ten thousand things.

The ten thousand things carry yin and embrace yang.
They achieve harmony by combining these forces.

People hate to be “orphaned,” “widowed,” or “worthless,”
But this is how the wise describe themselves.

For one gains by losing
And loses by gaining.

What others teach, I also teach; that is:
“A violent person will die a violent death!”
This is the essence of my teaching.

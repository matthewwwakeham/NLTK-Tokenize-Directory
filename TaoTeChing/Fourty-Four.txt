Forty-Four

Fame or self: Which matters more?
Self or wealth: Which is more precious?
Gain or loss: Which causes more pain?

Those who are attached to things will suffer greatly.
Those who save will suffer heavy losses.
Those who are contented are never disappointed.
Those who know when to stop do not find themselves in trouble.
They remain forever safe.

Nineteen

Give up sainthood, renounce wisdom,
And it will be a hundred times better for everyone.

Give up kindness, renounce morality,
And people will rediscover filial piety and love.

Give up ingenuity, renounce profit,
And bandits and thieves will disappear.

These three are outward forms alone: they are not sufficient in themselves.
It is more important
To see the simplicity,
To realize our true nature,
To cast off selfishness
And temper desire.

Seventy-Eight

Under heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water.
Yet for attacking the solid and strong, nothing is better;
It has no equal.
The weak can overcome the strong;
The supple can overcome the stiff.
Under heaven everyone knows this,
Yet no one puts it into practice.
Therefore the wise say:
“If you take on the humiliation of the people, you are fit to rule them. If you take upon yourself the country’s disasters,
You deserve to be ruler of the universe.”
The truth often sounds paradoxical.

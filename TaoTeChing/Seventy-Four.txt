Seventy-Four

If people are not afraid to die,
It is of no avail to threaten them with death.

If people live in constant fear of dying,
And if breaking the law means that someone will be killed,
Who will dare to break the law?

There is always an official executioner.
If you try to take his place,
It is like trying to be a master carpenter and cutting wood.
If you try to cut wood like a master carpenter, you will only hurt your hand.

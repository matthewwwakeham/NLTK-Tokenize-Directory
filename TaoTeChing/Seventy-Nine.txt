Seventy-Nine

After a bitter quarrel, some resentment remains.
What can be done about this?
The wise keep their half of the bargain
But do not exact their due.
Virtuous people perform their part,
But those without Virtue require others to fulfill their obligations.
The Tao of heaven is impartial.
It remains with those who are good.

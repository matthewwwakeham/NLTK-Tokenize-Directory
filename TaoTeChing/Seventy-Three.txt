Seventy-Three

A brave and passionate person will kill or be killed.
A brave and calm person will always preserve life.
Of these two which is good and which is harmful?
Some things are not favored by heaven. Who knows why?
Even the wise are unsure of this.

The Tao of heaven does not strive and yet it overcomes.
It does not speak and yet is answered.
It does not ask, yet all its needs are met.
It seems to have no aim and yet its purpose is fulfilled.

Heavenâ€™s net is cast wide.
Though its meshes are coarse, nothing slips through.

Seventy-Two

When people lack a sense of awe, there will be disaster.

Do not intrude into their homes.
Do not harass them at work.
If you do not interfere, they will not weary of you.

Therefore the wise know themselves but make no show,
Have self-respect but are not arrogant.
They let go of that and choose this.

Seventy

My words are easy to understand and easy to perform,
Yet no one under heaven knows them or practices them

My words have ancient beginnings.
My actions are disciplined.
Because people do not understand, they have no knowledge of me.

Those that know me are few;
Those that abuse me are honored.
Therefore the wise wear rough clothing and hold the jewel in their heart.

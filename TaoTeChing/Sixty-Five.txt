Sixty-Five

In the beginning those who knew the Tao did not try to enlighten others,
But kept it hidden.
Why is it so hard to rule?
Because the people are so clever.
Rulers who try to use cleverness
Cheat the country.
Those who rule without cunning
Are a blessing to the land.
These are the two alternatives.
Understanding these is Primal Virtue.
Primal Virtue goes deep and far.
It leads all things back
Toward the great oneness.

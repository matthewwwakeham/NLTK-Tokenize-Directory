Sixty-One

A great nation is like low land.
It is the meeting ground of the universe,
The mother of the universe.

The female overcomes the male with stillness,
Lying low in stillness.

Therefore if a great nation yields to a smaller nation,
It will conquer the smaller nation.
And if a smaller nation submits to a great nation,
It can conquer the great nation.
Therefore those who would conquer must yield,
And those who conquer do so through yielding.

A great nation needs more people;
A small nation needs to serve.
Each gets what it wants.
It is fitting for a great nation to yield.

Sixty-Six

Why is the sea king of a hundred streams?
Because it lies below them.
Therefore it is the king of a hundred streams.

If you would guide the people, you must serve with humility.
If you would lead them, you must follow behind.
In this way when you rule, the people will not feel oppressed;
When you stand before them, they will not be harmed.
The whole world will support you and will not tire of you.

Because you do not compete,
You will not have competition.

Sixty-Three

Practice non-action.
Work without doing.
Taste the tasteless.
Magnify the small, increase the few.
Reward bitterness with care.

See simplicity in the complicated.
Achieve greatness in small things.

In the universe the difficult things are done as though they were easy.
In the universe great acts are made up of small deeds.
The wise do not attempt anything very big,
And thus achieve greatness.

Easy promises make for little trust.
Taking things lightly results in great difficulty.
Because the wise always confront difficulties,
They never experience them.

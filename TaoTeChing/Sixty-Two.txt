Sixty-Two

Tao is the source of the ten thousand things.
It is the treasure of the good and the refuge of the bad.
Sweet words can buy honor;
Good deeds can gain respect.
If people are bad, do not abandon them.
Therefore on the day the emperor is crowned,
Or the three officers of state installed,
Do not send a gift of jade and a team of horses,
But remain still and offer the Tao.
Why does everyone value the Tao?
Isnâ€™t it because you find what you seek and are forgiven when you sin?
Therefore this is the greatest treasure in the universe.

Ruling the country is like cooking a small fish.
Approach the universe with Tao,
And evil will have no power.
Not that evil is not powerful,
But its power will not be used to harm others.
Not only will it do no harm to others,
But the wise will also be protected.
We will not hurt one another,
And the Virtue in each of us refreshes everyone.

Thirty-Four

The great Tao flows everywhere, both to the left and to the right.
The ten thousand things depend on it; it holds nothing back.
It fulfills its purpose silently and makes no claim.

It nourishes the ten thousand things,
But does not rule them.
It has no aim; it is very small.

The ten thousand things return to it,
Yet it does not rule them.
It is very great.

It does not show greatness,
And is therefore truly great.

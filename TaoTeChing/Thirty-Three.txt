Thirty-Three

Knowing others is wisdom;
Knowing the self is enlightenment.
Mastering others requires force;
Mastering the self needs strength.

Those who know they have enough are rich.
Perseverance is a sign of willpower.
Those who stay where they are endure.
To die but not to perish is to be eternally present.

Thirty-Two

The Tao is forever undefined.
Small though it is in the unformed state, it cannot be grasped.
If leaders could harness it,
The ten thousand things would naturally obey.
Heaven and earth would come together
And gentle rain fall.
People would no longer need laws and all things would take their course.

Once the whole is divided, the parts need names.
There are already enough names.
We need to know when to stop.
Knowing when to stop averts trouble.
Tao in the world is like a river flowing home to the sea.

Twenty-Four

Those who stand on tiptoe are not steady.
Those who stride cannot maintain the pace.
Those who put on a show are not enlightened.
Those who are self-righteous are not respected.
Those who boast achieve nothing.
Those who brag will not endure.
According to followers of the Tao,
“These are unnecessary food and baggage.”
They do not bring happiness.
Therefore followers of the Tao avoid them.

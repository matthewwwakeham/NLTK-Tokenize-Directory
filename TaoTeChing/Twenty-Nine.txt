Twenty-Nine

Do you think you can conquer the universe and improve it?
I do not believe this can be done.

The universe is sacred.
You cannot improve it.
If you try to change it, you will ruin it.
If you try to hold on to it, you will lose it.

So sometimes things are ahead and sometimes they are behind;
Sometimes breathing is hard, sometimes it comes easily;
Sometimes there is strength, and sometimes weakness;
Sometimes one is up and sometimes down.

Therefore the wise avoid extremes, excesses, and complacency.

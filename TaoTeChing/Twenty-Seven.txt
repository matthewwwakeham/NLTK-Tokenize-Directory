Twenty-Seven

A good walker leaves no tracks;
A good speaker makes no slips;
A good reckoner needs no tally.
A good door needs no lock,
Yet no one can open it.
Good binding requires no knots,
Yet no one can loosen it.

Therefore the wise take care of everyone
And abandon no one.
They take care of all things
And abandon nothing.

This is called “following the light.”

What is a good person?
The teacher of a bad person.
What is a bad person?
A good person’s charge.
If the teacher is not respected,
And the student not cared for,
Confusion will arise, however clever one is.
This is the crux of mystery.

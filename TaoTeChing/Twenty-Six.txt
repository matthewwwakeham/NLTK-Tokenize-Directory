Twenty-Six

The heavy is the root of the light;
The still is the master of unrest.

Therefore the wise, traveling all day,
Do not lose sight of their baggage.
Though there are beautiful things to be seen,
They remain unattached and calm.

Why should the lord of ten thousand chariots act lightly in public?
To be light is to lose our root.
To be restless is to lose control.

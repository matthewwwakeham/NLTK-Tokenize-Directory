Twenty-Three

To talk little is natural.
High winds do not last all morning.
Heavy rain does not last all day.
Why is this? Heaven and earth!
If heaven and earth cannot make things last forever,
How is it possible for us?

Those who follow the Tao
Are at one with the Tao.
Those who are virtuous
Experience Virtue.
Those who lose their way
Are lost.
When you are at one with the Tao,
The Tao welcomes you.
When you are at one with Virtue,
Virtue is always there.
When you are at one with loss,
Loss is experienced willingly.

Those who do not trust enough
Will not be trusted.

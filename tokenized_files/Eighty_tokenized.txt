Eighty small country fewer people . Though machines work ten hundred times faster people , needed . people take death seriously travel far . Though boats carriages , one uses . Though armor weapons , one displays . People return knotting rope place writing . food plain healthy , clothes fine simple , homes secure ; happy lives . Though live within sight neighbors , crowing cocks barking dogs heard across way , Yet leave peace grow old die .

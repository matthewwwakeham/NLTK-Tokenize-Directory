Forty-One wise student hears Tao practices diligently . average student hears Tao thinks . foolish student hears Tao laughs loud laughter , Tao would . Hence said : bright path seems dim ; Going forward seems like retreat ; easy way seems hard ; highest Virtue seems empty ; Great purity seems sullied ; wealth Virtue seems inadequate ; strength Virtue seems frail ; Real Virtue seems unreal ; perfect square corners ; Great talents ripen late ; highest notes hard hear ; greatest form shape . Tao hidden without name . Tao alone nourishes brings everything fulfillment .

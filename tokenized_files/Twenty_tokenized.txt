Must fear others fear ? nonsense ! people contented , enjoying sacrificial feast ox . spring go park climb terrace , alone drifting , knowing .

Oh , drift like waves sea , Without direction , like restless wind . Everyone else busy , alone aimless without desire . different . nourished great mother .
